## Bugs and Features

If you have found any bugs or would like to request a new feature, please do
check in the project's GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon2020/issues), if there is a similar existing
issue already filed. If not, please file a new issue.

If you want to help out by fixing bugs, choose an issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon2020/issues) to work on and claim it by posting a comment saying "I would like to
work on this.". Feel free to ask any doubts in the issue thread.

Once you have implemented the feature to an extent, go ahead and file a pull
request by following the tips below.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests should be small to facilitate easier review. Keep them
self-contained, and limited in scope. Studies have shown that review quality
falls off as patch size grows. Sometimes this will result in many small PRs to land a single large feature.

### Checklist:

1. Always create a new branch to work on a new issue::
    $ git checkout -b <branch-name>
2. Make sure your branch is up-to-date with upstream master before you file
   a pull request.
3. All pull requests *must* be made against the ``master`` branch.
4. In case of UI changes, please include screenshots.
